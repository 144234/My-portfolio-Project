    <p>I love reading and tennis. I love reading long novels or science books that fill me up with knowledge and/or imagination. In my opnion reading is one of the best habits a person can develop it helps a person calm down and can entertain you even during the boringest of times. I love reading books not just of my level but higher. When I was in 2nd grade I used to read books 5th and 6th graders would read. I als0 love playing tennis. While reading helps mestay calm tennis helps me funnel all my energy. It is also another way for me to relax. It dosen;t help me learn something but it gives mental peace and helps me physically. Tennis helps me get the exercise that I need but in a fun way by defeating my opponents or learning from my oponents. </p>
